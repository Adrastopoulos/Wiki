Direwolf20 1.7.10
=================

Concept
-------
The Direwolf20 Pack is a modpack for Minecraft 1.7.10. It was created in cooperation with Feed The Beast for and by Direwolf20, a popular YouTube personality known for his mod spotlights, tutorials and Let's Play series. This pack uses the same mod configuration as used in Season 7 of his single-player Let's Play series, and thus supports playing the series' map snapshots released every ten episodes.
