The Ferret Business
===================

Concept
-------
Welcome to The Ferret Business, new assistants! As part of the largest corporation, we deal in all manner of things: from technology to magic, farming to cooking, even life and death. Every assistant, including yourself now, are important in keeping The Business running, as even the smallest gear helps the machine!

But you, you are unique! First day on the job, you were tasked with assisting one of our researchers in Yet Another Teleportation Test. And...it worked! Sort of...see, teleporting across the street, to the moon, heck even to another solar system is easy. Well, easy relative to..whatever JUST happened to you. 

You are on a strange world in a strange dimension. We can communicate with you, and send items back and forth through your handy, dandy QUEST Tablet, but...unfortunately, we can't seem to bring you home, nor does it seem like we can send you anyone else to help get you home.

Wherever you are, I think you can become our biggest asset to date, something that will help The Business grow even larger! Wherever you are is special, and working together with all our top researchers, scientists, and wizards here, we can discover so many new things! In return, you will get paid, receive rewards, accolades, a better job, heck you might even get onto the Board of Directors if you do well!

So, are you ready, Assistant?
