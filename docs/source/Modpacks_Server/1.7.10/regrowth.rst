Regrowth
========

Concept
-------
Let me introduce you all to the modpack I've been working on - Regrowth.
It's a HQM driven pack where you find yourself in a desolate wasteland, lacking in natural growth and sparse of materials except for a few boulders and dead, charred trees. You'll quickly discover the depths of the earth to be barren as well, devoid of any form of ore. You will need to find a way to start restoring the presence of nature back to the world, and in doing so find yourself a way to start producing the materials you'll need to produce a thriving industry.

The pack is heavily adjusted to be a more cohesive experience through the usage of minetweaker and modtweaker, with just over 1000 lines of scripts at the time of writing this.
A large part of the idea behind the pack came from a couple of "what if?"s. Specifically, the pack was designed to be without ore, but while still having a world to work with. The other was to do so without the use of something like Ex Nihilo, finding a way to unlock access to resources for the player with the standard mods that exist in the pack.
