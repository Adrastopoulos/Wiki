Crackpack 3
===========

Concept
-------
Crackpack is back! The popular modpack series has a new installment in 1.12.2 Minecraft. Join the Mindcrack members as they're fueled by exploration, combat, wizardry, explosions, alchemy, and more! You can lay siege upon barbarian villages or travel to a myriad of exciting dimensions. This project was unlocked as an incentive for the 2019 Mindcrack Marathon which raised over $250,000 for Extra Life.

This modpack includes a number of popular mods as well as some new ones. Both magic and tech are available for a diverse play-style experience. You will be able to recruit an army, train pet rats to do your bidding, or fly over the meticulously sculpted environment in a bath tub. Not only is the surface redesigned from anything you have seen, but beneath the surface lies an expansive cave system ripe for plundering. Travel to other worldly locations using a unique teleportation method. This non-linear, player-driven narrative allows you to cultivate your own story
