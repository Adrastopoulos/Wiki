SkyFactory 4
============

Concept
-------

Back again for more modded skyblock fun! SkyFactory 4 offers a brand-new experience never before seen in the series. Full automation, tech, magic, and bacon resources! This iteration offers over 30+ world types so you can play the pack like never before! While some world types are based on the classic tree on dirt others are designed with unique recipes and advancements.

Gaining Prestige with Cachet
----------------------------

SkyFactory 4 also introduces the prestige system! Seen in the normal modpack this utilizes the Parabox to generate points but MYM has their very own unique plugin to generate these points for you created by our very own Matryoshika. Here is how it works:

Every time you complete a tab, you get a point. Once you complete one tab you will start earning one prestige point per tab per hour. 

* 1 Tab Completed: 1 Prestige point per hour.
* 2 Tabs Completed: 2 Prestige points per hour.

And so on.
