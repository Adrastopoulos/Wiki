SkyFactory 4
============

Concept
-------

Back again for more modded skyblock fun! SkyFactory 4 offers a brand-new experience never before seen in the series. Full automation, tech, magic, and bacon resources! This iteration offers over 30+ world types so you can play the pack like never before! While some world types are based on the classic tree on dirt others are designed with unique recipes and advancements.

Gaining Prestige with Cachet
----------------------------

Skyfactory 4 includes a point gathering system called "Prestige Points." Prestige is seen in Skyfactory 4 normally by the use of the parabox mod. As this mod is not server friendly, we have disabled the mod for the most part. With the help of MyM's own Matryoshika, we have developed a plugin to gain prestige passively.

Every time you complete a tab, you get a point. Once you complete one tab you will start earning one prestige point per tab per hour. 

* 1 Tab Completed: 1 Prestige point per hour.
* 2 Tabs Completed: 2 Prestige points per hour.

For example, you will see something that looks like this:

And so on.
