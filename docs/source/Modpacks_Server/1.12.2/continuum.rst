FTB Continuum
=============

Concept
-------
FTB Continuum is an expert style modpack packed with some of the latest tech mods by Feed the Beast!  Majority of the recipes and intended progression that you are used to has been changed.  Continuum introduces new, never before used mods to make things even more difficult and challenging.  The overall goal of this pack is to extend game play by making large changes to progression throughout the mods.  This pack contains a lot of custom quests to help you progress and provide tips/tricks and even rewards as you play through Continuum.  Note that the quests are completely optional to play through the pack, but highly suggested due to the large number of game play changes.  The survival difficulty has not been changed other than the introduction of Spice of Life, however this is setup in a way where itâ€™s not a burden to the player.  Good luck and enjoy!
