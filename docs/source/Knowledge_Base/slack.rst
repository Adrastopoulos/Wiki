Guidelines
==========

Below is a list of simple rules helping you to achieve the most out of using general IRC channels

- **Diffrent channels** Our public slack has many channels these are used for diffrent purposes such as #support which is linked to a staff slack this allows staff to help you
- **#Support** is only used for support questions if you are crashing or having other issues if you just want to talk please use #random
- **How do i sign up to slack?** you sign up here http://foxtrot.mym.li:3000/
- **Be friendly and refrain from acting demanding** No one is obligated to help you, so don't act like they would be. The chance of being ignored raises with your level of demanding and unfriendliness.
- **Be patient!** Responses can take hours. People in an IRC channel are not there waiting for people to join and chat with them. They might not even be on the computer, be focused on work or playing a game. Give them time to respond and don't wait for an answer. (Do it like them and have IRC open in background, checking from time to time for updates/responses)
