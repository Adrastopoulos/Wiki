Guidelines
==========

Below is a list of simple rules that will enchance the expierence for you and the rest of the community!

- **Diffrent channels** Our public discord has many channels these are used for diffrent purposes such as #support which is linked to one of staff's slack channels.
- **#Support** is only used for support questions if you are crashing or having other issues if you just want to talk please do not use this channel, use the channel corresponding to your wishes, or #general for general chatter.
- **How do i sign up for discord?** You can sign up for a free discord account at http://discord.gg , once you have, you can follow this link: http://mym.li/discord to join us.
- **Be friendly** No one is obligated to help you, nor here to have people be mean to them, so please, try to remain calm while waiting for someone to help you. 
- **Be patient!** Responses can take a little while. People that are on Discord are usually not sitting there, waiting for you to ask your question. They might not even be on the computer, be focused on work or playing a game. Give them time to respond, and go play a game, relax or grab something to eat or drink in the process.
