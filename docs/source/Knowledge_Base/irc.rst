.. warning::
   Avoid frustration and speed up getting to a solution by reading the following guidelines. As things are not like you may be used to.

Unless you are a IRC power user please read up on the following guidelines in order to avoid frustration and get to a solution faster. IRC and its usage is not like a normal chat room. Real life matters of friendliness often delay support and cause frustration.

Guidelines
==========

Below is a list of simple rules helping you to achieve the most out of using general IRC channels

- **Simply ask your question**, there is need to ask if you might ask.. This only delays an answer to your question or help on a matter. *Further busy IRC users tend to answer to quick forward questions but don't respond to "might I ask, anyone around, how is it going.." due to the extra work and being unfriendly than not responding to a question requiring more than a few words.*
- **Ask direct questions and include relevant information.** Increase the possibility of a quick respond by asking questions in a way where simple answers can be made without the need of asking for more details.
- **Keep it short!** No one wants to read a wall of text while being busy, so keep it short but still include all relevant information and allow for a quick answer.
- **Be patient!** Responses can take hours. People in an IRC channel are not there waiting for people to join and chat with them. They might not even be on the computer, be focused on work or playing a game. Give them time to respond and don't wait for an answer. (Do it like them and have IRC open in background, checking from time to time for updates/responses)
- **Tag specific users?** In case you know who to speak to, `tag` him by including the full IRC name in the message, this causes the users IRC client to send out an alert. When the user is active he will be notified about your message. Do not abuse it, or you might be removed from the channel without receiving any help.
- **Be friendly and refrain from acting demanding** No one is obligated to help you, so don't act like they would be. The chance of being ignored raises with your level of demanding and unfriendliness.
- **Crash related issue?** If your issue is related to a client crash, please check out [this post](https://mineyourmind.net/forum/wiki/crash-report/) and include the link to the crash-report in your question. *Posting a massive amount of characters will auto kick you from the IRC channel.*
