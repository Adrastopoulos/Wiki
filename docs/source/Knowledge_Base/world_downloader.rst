How to use MyM World Downloader
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

How to: Using Claims
====================

1. Add your claims to world downloader by running the command ``/wd add claim`` while standing in your claims (works for trusted members too). If you have multiple claims, repeat this for all your claims before moving on to step 2.

2. Once you have added the claims, you can run the command ``/wd dl <downloadName>`` to download the selected claims.

* This will download a few things which you will need to use later.

How to: Using Radius
====================

1. Add a radius around you to world downloader by running the command ``/wd add radius <number>`` while standing in the desired area. Repeat this for all the areas you want to save before moving on to step 2.

2. Once you have added a radius, you can run the command ``/wd dl <downloadName>`` to download the selected area.

* This will download a few things which you will need to use later.

How do I use the download?
==========================

Once you have your download, it will only download the essentials to make a world for it. Here is what it should download:

* playerdata (folder)
* region (folder)
* level.dat

In order to use this, you need to make your own version of the world in single player. Here's how:

1. Go to the singleplayer tab in Minecraft and click "Create New World". Name it something you will remember such as ``MyM Singleplayer`` and make sure it's set to survival with the default world generation options!

2. Once the world loads, exit out of the world back to the menu.

3. Open up the saves folder for minecraft. If you are using the MyM Launcher and used the default installation directory on windows, this is located at: ``AppData/roaming/.mineyourmind/instances/<instance name>/minecraft/saves``. A shortcut to get here is to open the MyM launcher, right click the pack you are playing and select ``View Folder`` and then go to the ``saves`` folder.

* Other launchers have similar methods of getting to where it's installed. A quick search around will probably show you how (whether on google or just around the launcher's options)

4. Navigate to the folder named what ever you named the world in Step 1, and copy all the files from the world download there. This will ask you if you want to replace them, make sure to click yes to all of the dialog items! If you don't, some parts will not replace properly.

5. Go back to the main menu of Minecraft, then back to Singleplayer and load the world. This should put you where you were when you downloaded the server and you should have all your stuff you saved! Keep in mind, things like homes will **not** transfer so you may want to write coordinates down for key areas while on the server so you can get back to them in singleplayer.

.. note:: If you still have issues downloading the world or setting it up, please make a ticket using ``/ticket create``
