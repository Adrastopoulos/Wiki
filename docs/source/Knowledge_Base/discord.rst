Introduction
============
.. What is Discord?::

Discord is an app that allows you to communicate with other players and staff either by chatting in text channels or talking to people in voice channels


Guidelines
==========
**All** MyM rules apply in **All** channels. Anything that breaks those rules will subject you to a verbal warning, or possibly a ban from the discord. Inappropriate avatars/names will result in you being kicked from the server until you pick an appropriate alternative.

Our public discord has many channels these are used for different purposes. Here is a list of all the general text channels and their purposes.

- **#Support** is only used for support questions. This channel is linked to the Staff chat so there may be other staff available then what is shown on discord. Please be patient as we cannot be available 24/7
- **#Support_Patron** Just like #support, this is priority support for those who wish to support the server through our patron ranks. From Tier 1 to Tier 3, you will always have access to this channel as long as your subscription is active.
- **#general** is used to discuss anything in general. If there is no channel for it designated for a subject, you can talk about it here.
- **#minecraft** is used to discuss all things minecraft. From simple questions about mods, to showcasing your builds.
- **#global** is where the network's global chat comes to discord. You can send a message to the channel and anyone who has global chat on will be able to see it in game.
- **#events** is used to discuss events and what is happening with them. Contestants post here to ask questions of the event staff team, and some people post there to get info about the coming events.
- **#technology** is where you can talk about all things tech. Post a pic of your setup, talk about a new program you found or even discuss computer builds there.
- **#random** is a channel where you can be random. You can post memes here as long as they are appropriate and follow all the MyM rules.
- **#games** is where you can chat about new games, or even share links to games you found for free. Please refrain from posting Violent, Graphic or Inappropriate games.
- **#looking-for-group** The name says it all! Look for groups using this channel.

Additional Notes
================
- **How do I sign up for discord?** You can sign up for a free discord account `here <http://discord.gg>`_ and once you have an account, you can click `this link <http://mym.li/discord>`_ to join us.
- **Be friendly!** No one is obligated to help you, nor here to have people be mean to them, so please try to remain calm while waiting for someone to help you. 
- **Be patient!** Responses can take a little while. People that are on Discord are usually not sitting there, waiting for you to ask your question. They might not even be on the computer, be focused on work or playing a game. Give them time to respond, and go play a game, relax or grab something to eat or drink in the process.
