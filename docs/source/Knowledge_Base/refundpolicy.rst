Our policy for refunds on lost items.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Why we have enacted this policy
===============================

Recently, we have been getting a lot of requests for refunds on items in game that might have been lost in a mod bug/glitch, 
a server crash, an internal error, clear lag, etc. We all understand that this is a frustrating situation, especially after all the work 
that was put into gathering/crafting those lost items. Unfortunately, we do have a **No Refund** policy on those items. The reasons we have a 
policy like this in place isn't for spite, I assure you we are here to make the best experience possible for you, the player.

To put things into perspective for this reason: This is a Network of several unique physical servers creating a multitude of 
servers(~14 of the time of this post) with Mods, Devs, Admins, etc constantly working 24 hours a day to continually build a bigger better 
network for you the player. We have approximately 150,000 unique player joins and 2k active at any given time in our network, and just over 
30 members of staff at any given day. Just being in charge of the staff is almost a full-time job, none-the-less the other aspects of this 
network. Now saying all that, if we had a for sure refunds ok policy, that would add a ton of really unnecessary work for the staff. 
It would probably almost double the staff to be able to handle all these issues.

Points to take into consideration
=================================

Some examples on how much work it would create to refund every single item that players lose includes:

1. If you were in single player (Without access to cheats), you would shrug it off and continue despite what happened.
2. Approximately 95% of issues related to disappearing items are due to the mods themselves, and are completely seperate from the MyM
network directly (You wouldn't call Microsoft/Apple for a problem with your monitor or keyboard).
3. Everyone (including the staff) at some point or another, given a long enough timeline has dealt with the same thing and to be fair to 
those that are ok with it at the time and never say anything, a **"No Refunds"** makes it the most fair to **all** players (Those choosing
to not refund your items have also been refused for their items to be refunded).
4. Trust. Who's to say that the player you are competing against says, "I just accidentally dropped my keyboard and it pressed Q permanently 
on my stack of [awesome endgame items]!!" It's again, another issue of being fair.

Report these bugs or glitches to us!
====================================

Aside from the reasons why we don't refund items, we do not want to stop you from letting us know if a bug or glitch is happening. 
**Please report the errors/bugs/glitches to your appropriate modpack Support section,** your input could save others from making the same 
mistake, sometimes even get the issue fixed, or sometimes (In **extreme** circumstances, no promises) getting your items back as a 
result of solving the bug. 

A brief summary
===============

To summarize: We **do not** refund items, especially for reasons such as:
* Deaths (Be careful when fighting mobs, however if your grave is in a claim let us know)
* Accidental key presses (Pressed q when flying over the void or lava)
* PvP kills
* ClearLag or item clear (Both give sufficient warnings)
* Mod errors (BetterStorage, NBT overflow (**Do not** put a ME drive in a backpack), TombManyGraves, etc).
* Grief/Theft (Please read the section covering our protection plugin)

And **make sure** to report any errors to the appropriate section in the forums (Modpack support forums, private bug reports, etc).
