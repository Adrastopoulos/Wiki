What protection does this server use?
-------------------------------------

Generally, we use GriefPrevention due to its ease of use for the player. Other servers with modpacks like Agrarian Skies or Crash Landing use WorldGuard regions created from the skyblock plugin. Both third-party protection systems are extended by our custom ProtectEx extension to protect against more modded items. More information about Grief Prevention can be found :ref:`here <ref-griefprevention>`.


What is the difference between Farmworld and Overworld? What does Farmworld mean?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Overworld (build world) is one of the only worlds which isn't being reset. All the other worlds might be reset from time to time, so building there is not advisable. The Farmworld looks like the Overworld with the difference that quarries (which leave huge holes) and turtles are allowed. This world is meant to be taken apart for resource farming. It is being reset on a regular basis to allow new players to acquire depleted resources like beehives.


When will the Farmworld and other secondary worlds be reset?
------------------------------------------------------------

We have an automated secondary world reset system in place. Farmworlds are being reset on a monthly basis and The End on weekly, to learn more please see `this thread <https://mineyourmind.net/forum/threads/automatic-farmworld-resets.11702/>`_.


Are there any warnings prior to the reset?
------------------------------------------

Warnings are given around 5-7 days before with automated ingame announcements. We will also make an announcment in advance on the forums `here <https://mineyourmind.net/forum/forums/announcements.152/>`__


How do I get more Claimblocks?
------------------------------

You can change MyMs and tokens into Claimblocks. You get tokens from voting, which you can then exchange for Claimblocks (or MyMs) in the ``/shop``. On some servers, you can also get MyMs from trading, which you can also exchange for Claimblocks.


Is there a limit to the amount of Claimblocks you can have?
-----------------------------------------------------------

There is a limit, but you don't really need to worry about it as it is quite high. Should you ever reach the limit, open up a support thread on the forums and we will increase it.


Can you remove this claim next to mine?
---------------------------------------

We utilize an automatic reset system on our servers. Claims get removed after 2 weeks of inactivity from the claim owner. Members of the claim can request a transfer to them after the 7th day of inactivity. They can do this by creating a ticket in game by jumping to :ref:`here <create-ticket>` or by creating a forums post `here <https://mineyourmind.net/forum/categories/support-forums.155/>`__
