How to change the file directory
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Create a new ``text document``.
2. Include the following code in to the text document:

.. code-block:: none
   SET sPath=%appdata%
   SET AppData=[Location]
   MyM-Launcher.exe
   SETAppdata=%sPath%
   
3. Change [Location] to your custom directory (For example: ``D:\Program Files (x86)\MyMLauncher``).
4. Save the document as ``MyM-Launcher.bat`` in the same directory as the ``MyM-Launcher.exe``.
5. Run the ``MyM-Launcher.bat`` to download and start the modpacks.
